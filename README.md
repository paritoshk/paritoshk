### Hi there. I'm Paritosh ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ I'm currently working on: Creating algorithms to automate the deal flow process and find catalysts in the market with NLP to enrich thematic investing.
- ðŸ‘¯ I'm looking to collaborate on: NLP and AI-powered models for deal flow sourcing and automation and creating software for portflio managers.
- ðŸ¤” I'm looking for help with the Portfolio construction tool I am building now.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about AI Ethics, NLP in finding outliers in unstructured and under-fitted data, and finding needles in haystack problems.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: pck2123@columbia.edu
- âš¡ I enjoy predictive modeling of biochemical, clinical, and financial processes. I geek on the human brain, chess, and cocktails.
- ðŸŒ± I'm addicted to curiosity and cold start problems in the venture. I am learning about the intersection between NLP and Network Theory to create a curated graph neural network for niche VC investors, PE firms, and family fund offices.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I could play drums in the air with music and play chess without a chess board!
