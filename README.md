- âš¡ I enjoy predictive modeling of biochemical, clinical, and financial processes. I geek on the human brain, chess, and cocktails.
- ðŸŒ± I'm addicted to curiosity and cold start problems in the venture. I am learning about the intersection between NLP and Network Theory to create a curated graph neural network for niche VC investors, PE firms, and family fund offices.
